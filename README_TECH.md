This Angular project uses NgRx Store, which is a state management library inspired by Redux. Hereâ€™s how the implementation is structured in your codebase:

1. State Structure
The state is organized into feature slices, such as reviews and ui, under state.
Each slice has its own model, actions, reducer, selectors, and (for reviews) effects.
2. Key Concepts
Actions
Defined in files like reviews.actions.ts and ui.actions.ts.
Actions are plain objects describing state changes (e.g., add review, load reviews, set UI loading).
Reducers
Found in reviews.reducer.ts and ui.reducer.ts.
Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action, then return a new state.
Selectors
In reviews.selectors.ts and ui.selectors.ts.
Selectors are functions to query specific pieces of state for use in components.
Effects (for side effects)
In reviews.effects.ts.
Effects listen for specific actions and perform side effects (like API calls), then dispatch new actions with the results.
3. Usage in Features
Components and pages (e.g., in features/reviews/ and features/search/) dispatch actions and select state using NgRx Store.
The state is used to manage UI state (like loading indicators) and domain data (like reviews).
4. Benefits
Centralized, predictable state management.
Clear separation of concerns (actions, reducers, selectors, effects).
Easier debugging and testing.
